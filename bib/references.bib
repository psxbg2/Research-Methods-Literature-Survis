  abstract = {The analysis of trajectory datasets has numerous applications ranging from urban planning to human mobility understanding, but to protect the privacy of individuals trajectory datasets are rarely released to researchers. And even when they are, they are limited in size and spatio-temporal coverage. To address these issues a number of methods for generating synthetic yet realistic trajectory datasets have been proposed. These existing methods either require a lot of complex parameters to be calibrated (simulators) or rely on existing trajectory datasets (generative models). In this paper, we propose Data-Driven Trajectory Generator, dubbed DDTG, a data-driven, model-free, and parameter-less algorithm for generating realistic synthetic vehicle trajectory datasets. Unlike existing approaches, DDTG relies on aggregate origin-destination and traffic data, both of which are publicly available and free of privacy concerns. Furthermore, we show that our method is orthogonal to the existing approaches with which DDTG can be combined to generate synthetic datasets of higher quality. Our experiments with real-world trajectory and traffic data show that the datasets generated by DDTG follow distributions that are very close to the distributions of real trajectory datasets.},

Focusing on the dataset repository module, a collection of synthetic data that would simulate a variety of real life scenarios is required. Several algorithms have been implemented in the past to generate static spatial (point or rectangular) data, for instance, following a predefined distribution in the workspace. However, by introducing motion, and thus temporal evolution in spatial object definition, generating synthetic data tends to be a complex problem. In this paper, we discuss the parameters to be considered by a generator for such type of data, propose an algorithm, called “Generate_Spatio_Temporal_Data” (GSTD), which generates sets of moving point or rectangular data that follow an extended set of distributions. Some actual generated datasets are also presented. The GSTD source code and several illustrative examples are currently available to all researchers through the Internet.},

We design a simple and intuitive yet effective embedding for locations traces, and use generative adversarial networks to produce data points in this space, which will finally be transformed back to a sequential location trajectory form. We evaluate our method on realistic location trajectories and compare our synthetic traces with multiple existing methods on how they preserve geographic and semantic features of real traces at both aggregated and individual levels. Our empirical results prove the capability of our generative model in preserving various useful properties of real data.},

The sensitivity of medical records poses challenges for data access and sharing, making GAI a promising solution. The study evaluates five key approaches—StyleGAN2, CLIP, T5, ViT, and specialized Tabular GANs—across three critical dimensions: distribution fidelity, attribute correlation preservation, and pattern recognition accuracy. The results reveal the strengths and limitations of each technique in generating realistic medical data. StyleGAN2, CLIP, and T5 excel in all dimensions, making them ideal for various applications requiring high-quality synthetic medical datasets. ViT shows promise but may need fine-tuning for specific use cases, while specialized Tabular GANs demonstrate potential but vary in performance. This comparative analysis provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners at the intersection of Generative AI and healthcare data generation. It underscores the potential of Generative AI in addressing the tabular data generation challenge in medical records, offering realistic and privacy-conscious alternatives for data utilization and model training.},

  abstract = {To achieve zero touch automation in next generation wireless networks through artificial intelligence (AI), large amounts of training data is required. This training data is publicly unavailable and is a major hindrance in research on AI applications to wireless communication. One solution is using limited real data to generate synthetic data that can be used in lieu of real data. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have been used successfully for this purpose. In this paper, we choose two publicly available GAN - based models and one deep learning - based auto-regressive model. We then compare their performance at generating synthetic time-series wireless network traffic data. We also assess the impact of data scarcity on the generated data quality by varying the level of data available to the models for training. Moreover, in order to assess the usefulness of this generated data, we compare the performance of a gradient boosting regressor trained solely on generated data, real data, and a mix of both at forecasting network traffic. Our experiments show that the GANs perform better than the auto-regressive approach in each aspect considered in this work and forecasting models trained to predict network load based on data generated by these GANs yield error rates comparable to models trained on real data. Finally, augmenting small amounts of real data with generated data leads to minor performance gains in some cases.},

  volume   = {128},
  abstract = {Recently, an abundant amount of urban vehicle trajectory data has been collected in road networks. Many studies have used machine learning algorithms to analyze patterns in vehicle trajectories to predict location sequences of individual travelers. Unlike the previous studies that used a discriminative modeling approach, this research suggests a generative modeling approach to learn the underlying distributions of urban vehicle trajectory data. A generative model for urban vehicle trajectories can better generalize from training data by learning the underlying distribution of the training data and, thus, produce synthetic vehicle trajectories similar to real vehicle trajectories with limited observations. Synthetic trajectories can provide solutions to data sparsity or data privacy issues in using location data. This research proposes TrajGAIL, a generative adversarial imitation learning framework for the urban vehicle trajectory generation. In TrajGAIL, learning location sequences in observed trajectories is formulated as an imitation learning problem in a partially observable Markov decision process. The model is trained by the generative adversarial framework, which uses the reward function from the adversarial discriminator. The model is tested with both simulation and real-world datasets, and the results show that the proposed model obtained significant performance gains compared to existing models in sequence modeling.},

  abstract = {The end-user mobility patterns play a key role in the process of 5G network design. During tracking end-users via GPS, errors can appear. While we are still constrained with a very limited number of commercially available trajectory datasets, a possible solution is to extend an existing dataset using a generative adversarial network (GAN). Our previous work showed that the utilization of GAN in a form of artificial trajectory generator is possible but not flawless as it introduces the issue with unreasonable gaps between trajectory’s consecutive GPS coordinates. To overcome this issue with a generated dataset and with authentic data as well a special type of GAN called conditional GAN can be used. By leveraging this approach we are not only able to generate a potentially unlimited number of new data samples but as well to correct the existing ones. The number of missing datapoints in the trajectory can go as low as 95% of all points. This artificial intelligence approach has the potential to be used in various use cases where trajectory data are defective and need to be corrected.},

  abstract = {A growing interest in synthetic data has stimulated the development and advancement of a large variety of deep generative models for a wide range of applications. However, as this research has progressed, its streams have become more specialized and disconnected from one another. This is why models for synthesizing text data for natural language processing cannot readily be compared to models for synthesizing health records anymore. To mitigate this isolation, we propose a data-driven evaluation framework for generative models for synthetic sequential data, an important and challenging sub-category of synthetic data, based on five high-level criteria: representativeness, novelty, realism, diversity and coherence of a synthetic data-set relative to the original data-set regardless of the models’ internal structures. The criteria reflect requirements different domains impose on synthetic data and allow model users to assess the quality of synthetic data across models. In a critical review of generative models for sequential data, we examine and compare the importance of each performance criterion in numerous domains. We find that realism and coherence are more important for synthetic data natural language, speech and audio processing tasks. At the same time, novelty and representativeness are more important for healthcare and mobility data. We also find that measurement of representativeness is often accomplished using statistical metrics, realism by using human judgement, and novelty using privacy tests.},

  abstract = {Anonymous network traffic is more pervasive than ever due to the accessibility of services such as virtual private networks (VPN) and The Onion Router (Tor). To address the need to identify and classify this traffic, machine and deep learning solutions have become the standard. However, high-performing classifiers often scale poorly when applied to real-world traffic classification due to the heavily skewed nature of network traffic data. Prior research has found synthetic data generation to be effective at alleviating concerns surrounding class imbalance, though a limited number of these techniques have been applied to the domain of anonymous network traffic detection. This work compares the ability of a Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN), Copula Generative Adversarial Network (CopulaGAN), Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to create viable synthetic anonymous network traffic samples. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of several shallow boosting and bagging classifiers as well as deep learning models on the synthetic data. Ultimately, we amalgamate the data generated by the GANs, VAE, and SMOTE into a comprehensive dataset dubbed CMU-SynTraffic-2022 for future research on this topic. Our findings show that SMOTE consistently outperformed the other upsampling techniques, improving classifiers’ F1-scores over the control by ~7.5% for application type characterization. Among the tested classifiers, Light Gradient Boosting Machine achieved the highest F1-score of 90.3% on eight application types.},
